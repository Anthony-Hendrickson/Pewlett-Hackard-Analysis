# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?


## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees by title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in preparation for an exodus of geriatric employees.

## Results:

1. There are 72,458 current employees born between 1952 and 1955, which makes them all retirement age. The following query was used to get this information:

2. So that Bobby's manager can determine the future hiring and promotion/mentorship needs of the company in the face of the geriatric exodus, we also broke out the number of individuals of retirement age by role. See the screenshot below for the numbers:

3. So that Bobby's manager can decide which individuals are in a position to be mentored into soon to be vacant positions, we came up with a mentorship_eligibility table showing current employees born in 1965...I suppose employees born in 1965 (who are in their late 50s at this point) are very good people to mentor. There were 1,549 55 year olds.


## Summary:

I think Bobby's manager has a big problem on their hands. The company is expecting 72,458 employees to retire over the next couple of years. There certainly aren't enough 55 year old to cover this gap, so they should maybe be looking at a much broader population of their employees and plan accordingly.
